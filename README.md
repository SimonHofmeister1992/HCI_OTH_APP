## This Repository is for educational purposes
## The only purpose is the redesigning of a website the technical university of Regensburg uses, which is, a website for managing exams

### Therefore we won't code but redesign the whole UI and its features

  - Analysing the existing Webpage
  - Analyse, evaluate and understand use-context
  - Establish features by priorisation, writing the requirementsdocument and working out acceptance criteria
  - Building UI Prototypes by Sketching and Axure
  - Carry out and evaluate usertests with Axure-Prototypes
